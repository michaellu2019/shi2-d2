[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsdformat_vendor.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "sdformat_vendor", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "sdformat_vendor"
  with any of the following names:

    sdformat_vendorConfig.cmake
    sdformat_vendor-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "sdformat_vendor" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "sdformat_vendor_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "sdformat_vendor" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
